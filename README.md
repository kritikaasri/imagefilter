### ImageFilter
ImageFilter is a python script to generate filtered images. 
It works on png, jpeg and bmp, and generates an output file of the same type as the inputfile, except for one case, where it generates a GIF. 

The requirements are mentioned in the requirements.txt file, but it mainly uses PIL and openCV, except fot the cartooniser. 

The polyart function takes exceptionally long to execute, the others are relatively faster.
